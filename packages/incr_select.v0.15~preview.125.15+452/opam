synopsis: "Handling of large set of incremental outputs from a single input"
description: "
Ability to create a large set of incremental outputs based on a single
incremental input, where some subset of the outputs are selected to
have specific values, and the remainder are left with a specified
default value. The outputs are updated in time proportional to the
number of outputs that are changed, independent of the number of
outputs that exist.
