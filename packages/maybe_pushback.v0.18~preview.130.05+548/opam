synopsis: "Small library for asynchronous pushback"
description: "
Many operations have the property that they might return immediately, or they might
block on some system operation. A ['a Maybe_pushback.t] allows us to chain together
operations such that we do not jump into the Async scheduler until we hit an operation
that requires us to. It's the same as [Eager_deferred.t], but with a type that is unique
from [Deferred.t] so that you have to be more explicit about where you are willing to
yield to the scheduler.
