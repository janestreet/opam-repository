synopsis: "Hardcaml Verification Tools"
description: "
Tools for verifying properties of Hardcaml circuits.

Combinational circuits can be converted to 'conjunctive normal form' for input into SAT
solvers via DIMAC files. Support for a few opensource solvers is integrated - minisat,
picosat, Z3 - just ensure they are in your PATH.

Circuits can also be converted to NuSMV format for advanced bounded and unbounded model
checking tasks.
