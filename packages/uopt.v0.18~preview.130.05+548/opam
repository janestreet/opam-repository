synopsis: "An [option]-like type that incurs no allocation, without requiring a reserved value in the underlying type"
description: "
Uopt_base provides an unboxed option type, for use in high-performance systems which avoid allocation. It has several downsides as compared to [option], and is not recommended for use in general-purpose software.
