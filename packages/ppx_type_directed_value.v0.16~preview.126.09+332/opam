synopsis: "Get [@@deriving]-style generation of type-directed values without writing a ppx"
description: "
`Ppx_type_directed_value` is a ppx that does `[@@deriving]`-style
generation of type-directed values based on user-provided modules. The
user-provided modules tell `ppx_type_directed_value` how to compose
type-directed values (for example, combine type-directed values of the
fields of a record to form a type-directed value for the record
itself).

This allows a wide variety of PPXs such as `ppx_sexp_conv`,
`ppx_compare`, `ppx_enumerate`, etc. to be implemented with
`ppx_type_directed_value`, but with some runtime cost.

This PPX currently supports deriving type-directed values for records, ordinary
& polymorphic variants and tuples. It also supports custom user-defined attributes
on record and variant fields.
