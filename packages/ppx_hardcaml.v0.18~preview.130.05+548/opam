synopsis: "Rewrite OCaml records for use as Hardcaml Interfaces"
description: "
An interface in Hardcaml is an OCaml record with special attributes including
a bit width and RTL netlist name.  Input and output ports of a hardware design
can then be accessed through the OCaml record.  This allows easier management
of bundles of ports when working with the Simulator, Netlist generation or
hierarchical designs.
