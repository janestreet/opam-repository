synopsis: "Shared dependencies of bonsai and incr_dom."
description: """
This repo contains shared dependencies between incr_dom and bonsai: ui_incr
  and ui_time_source. Respectively, these libraries are bonsai and incr_dom's
  Incr.t and way of keeping track of time in a testable way.

  Both of these libraries are in their own repo (rather than in incr_dom's repo)
  as incr_dom's repo contains js_of_ocaml'able libraries, while both of these libraries
  do not depend on js_of_ocaml. Splitting these 'concrete' libraries to their own
  repo avoids a dependency of the bonsai repo on js_of_ocaml.
