# opam-repository

This repository is a package repository for the [opam package
manager](https://opam.ocaml.org).

It contains the development version of all Jane Street packages. To use
it, type:

```sh
opam repo add janestreet-bleeding https://ocaml.janestreet.com/opam-repository
```

Note that the above url is not the one of this github repository. It
is a mirror with static tarballs, which is more convenient to use.
